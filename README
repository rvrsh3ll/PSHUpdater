Requires the target system have Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0 or greater.
I will be adding the feature to check the target system and install silently soon.
I'll make the script completely automated if people start asking for it.


Run the script on your target:
wscript PSHUpdater.vbs //B //Nologo

Next, install quietly without user interaction:
wusa pshell3.msu /quiet /norestart

The install will take a few minutes depending on the target. I haven't tested enough yet but, I believe
it requires a reboot.

Check Version from command-line
powershell $PSVersionTable

Thanks to @samuel337 for the code to bypass limits on downloading large files.
